# About

Mot√©Bot is probably the Discord bot you needed. You can try it out by inviting it on your server. Open the following
link, choose the server you want to invite it on, and confirm.

https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=877173620923834408&permissions=2048&scope=bot

To try the bot, just answer it.

## Beware !

Inviting a bot can be dangerous. Any bot can access all the messages on the channel you authorize it. You may give it
other permissions, such as deleting messages or banning users. Be careful before confirming.

# Installation

## Dependencies

- Python
- pip

Any other dependency will be installed by pip in a virtual environment. These dependencies are:

- discord.py

## Install on your server / computer

More informations coming as I'll work on the installation.

## What's the installation doing ?

The installation will configure your files with your data (Discord token, message). It'll create and install a virtual
environment with the python dependencies. It'll then create a systemd unit that you can enable.

# Help

If you have honestly an issue with this bot, then you can file an issue here on Github. As for now, I don't have any
template, so just fill it as you wish. Try to describe your problem precisely.
